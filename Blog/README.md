## What is it?

The site is a basic blog about the journey to becomming a competent software developer. It does not matter what experience you have this site is about the journey itself. John Somnez @jsonmez from twitter would say trust the process!

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.
