                    <h2>I wanted to make a game that was simple but used what I have learnt</h2>
                    <p>So the other day I was contemplating what to make, I knew I wanted to take the concepts i've learnt so far with C# and wanted to make something simple but yet I didn't want to make it too simple as I was starting to understand some
                        advanced concepts.
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: left">
                        <p> So I decided upon Tic Tac Toe. The finished application can be shown in the screenshot below. </p>
                        <p>The game can currently be played by two players, however
                            as my coding skills get better I will add AI into it. If you are unaware TicTacToe is basically Naughts and crosses.</p>
                            <div id="imgcentre">
                            <img src="img/tictactoewin.png" height=350px; width=350px;>
                            </div>
                        <p>The idea was to make this ready available to run on Windows so I used WPF for this project.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="text-align: left">
                        <p>The project can be viewed and downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/carlhamilton/CSharpApplications/tree/master/TicTacToe" target="_blank">here</a>
                            <div id="imgcentre">
                                    <img src="img/tictactoecode.png" height=350px; width=350px;>
                                    </div>
                        <p>The code behind the project was built using C# and I made sure I created seperate methods and a Class, the idea behind this was to make it easier to read and be helpful if
                            a third party was to read the code.
                        </p>
                        <p>You should always code asking yourself could you read it if someone else had made it?</p>
                        <h2>Next came the Calculator, simple but coded to be more complex for understanding</h2>
                        <p>So with the Calculator I didn't want to just simply make a GUI version of a Calculator I coded in college.</p>
                        <p>I remember starting out with C++ and our class were given the task to code a Calculator using a console and back then the concept was fairly simple.</p>
                        <p>So a menu system was built asking the user with equation they want to use such as * / - and + then this called a switch statement and calculated the sum based on a case true statement.</p>
                        <p>This isn't very impressive now I look back at it, however it did get me a distinction and praise from the tutor due to my additional menu options such as calculating the binary and HEX.
                            However I made this with a little more love which can be found <a href="https://github.com/carlhamilton/CSharpApplications/tree/master/BasicCalculator/BasicCalculator" target="_blank">here</a>
                            I have posted a screenshot below</p>
                            <div id="imgcentre">
                                    <img src="img/calculator.png" height=350px; width=350px;>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>The code behind this had to be a little more complicated than my college work, therefore I included enums and Classes and then used inheritence to call these.
                                        An example snippet can be seen below</p>
                                        <div id="imgcentre">
                                                <img src="img/calculatecode.png" height=350px; width=350px;>
                                                </div>
                         <p>One thing the Calculator had to do was accomadate deleting characters if you make a mistake and also prevent a repeating . should you make a mistake.</p>
                         <p>Seperate methods were used as a method or function should only complete one task, if you make this more complicated it as a program grows it could become very hard to refactor
                             code at a later date.
                         </p>
                         <h2>Why this blog post?</h2>
                         <p>I wanted to show a few examples to just let you know that no matter what pace you learn at there will be programs you can make, some useful for a long time and some you will hate as your experience grows.
                             It is completely normal and you should always attempt to build things.
                         </p>
                         <p>Don't like Tic Tac Toe? Then pick another one popular game used to clone back in the 
                             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal" target="_blank">Turbo Pascal days</a> was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank">Pong</a> and it is certainly a classic.
                         </P>
